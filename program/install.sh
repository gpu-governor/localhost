 # this is the bash script of installing depencies on debian based distro
 # if you would like to use pip instead then just write the pip equivalent of the following command :
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
sudo apt python3-tk
sudo apt python3-opencv 
sudo apt python3-pil 
sudo apt-get install python3-pil.imagetk # sometimes after installing pillow it says imgtk missing so you can use this command to explicitly install it
